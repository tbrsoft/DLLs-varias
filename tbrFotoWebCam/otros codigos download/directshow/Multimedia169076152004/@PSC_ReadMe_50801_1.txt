Title: Multimedia Class Modules with a sample project
Description: And some work I have had in the past few days: a collection of class modules which are useful while making a multimedia player or another application which uses video or audio. Modules are: ActiveMovie, BrowseForFolderDialog, FileDialog, ID3v1 and Visualization. The sample program uses all of these. Supported fileformats are anything Windows can play (even OGGs if you have the DirectShow filter installed). I've some work left to do, such as finishing off my ID3v2 class module (which is not included yet, since it has only reading support). Comments are welcome!
