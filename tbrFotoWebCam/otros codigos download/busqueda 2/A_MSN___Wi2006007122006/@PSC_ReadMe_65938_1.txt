Title: A MSN / Windows Live Messenger Webcam Capture Utility
Description: Captures a webcam from MSN / Windows Live Messenger (or any other app) and saves the image to the disk. You choose how big to make the result, and where to crop it. Will only save an image to the disk if it differs from the last image it saved (so you dont get tons of the same image saved). Code is not commented, and may be hard to follow. Sorry about that, I just thought I'd share it incase anyone is interested =]
