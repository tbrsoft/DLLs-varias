Title: Encoding A Wave File To MP3 Part 2
Description: this code is to show how to make a dll in visual c++ 6 that can then be used in visual basic 6. you must have vc to compile teh dll since this site doesnt allow dll to be uploaded in the file. since i am makign this i figured might as well make something somewhat useful so i am making a dll wrapper for lame mp3 encoder lame_enc.dll which you can then use in vb so you can encode those mp3 files :) this isntmeant to be a full blown program. you can add more to make it mroe robust ;)
