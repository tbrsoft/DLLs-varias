Title: High Resolution hTimer
Description: hTimer is a mutlimedia timer class which can tick at intervals of 1ms using the timeSetEvent API. I have looked at other similar code and altered mine so that it doesn't crash when run compiled.
You can use import it into your project (1 Class and 1 Module) or you can just compile it to a dll file. This is described in the Readme.txt file included.
This timer uses the Formless timer Demo form to show the usage of the timer. 
Although I didn't code every single aspect of this and used peoples code to assist with subclassing and stuff I still put this together and rewrote a lot stuff to suit my activex dll.
