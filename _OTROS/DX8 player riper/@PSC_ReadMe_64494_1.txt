Description: Monoton is an audio library for playback/decoding/encoding of various audio formats.

it can decode (and therefore play) WAV, MP3, OGG Vorbis, WMA, APE and CDA, and encode WAV, MP3, OGG Vorbis, WMA and APE (for a list of dependencies :) check the readme).

For streaming playback it uses DirectSound 8 (so you'll need dx8vb.dll), which gives full control over the data (for DSP, analysis, visualisation).

Examples: 

1. Player (play all supported formats, shows tags, 3 visualisations (frequency domain (FFT), time domain, dBFS display), 5 band graphical equalizer (IIR Filter) + Preamp, effects (lowpass/highpass filter, echo, flanger), playlist), 

2. CD Ripper (grabs audio tracks to all supported formats for encoding), 

3. format transcoder (converts between all supported formats), 

4. simple (simplest possible playback)
