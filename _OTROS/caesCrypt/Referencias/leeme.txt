Title: SECURE encryption algorithms
Description: This is a collection of SECURE encryption algorithms (BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, SKIPJACK, TEA, GOST, RC4 and DES). This post contains highly optimized code, if a similar post already exist here on PSC this one is at least a couple of 1000x faster!!
This is not like everybody else's "unbreakable" code, these are standardized encryption algorithms where the only possible way to crack it is by brute-force. DES is probably the least secure one (it took 22 hours for a supercomputer + 100,000 computers to crack it (distributed.net)). And that's the least secure one. ;)
