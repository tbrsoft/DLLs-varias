== Gold Button by Night Wolf==
====================
Well, here it is. The new version of Gold Button.

What's new in v1.2?
 * Added: Base Address in OCX
 * Added: Property Descriptions
 * Added: MaskColor and UseMask Properties
    * Note: MaskColor Property works by replacing the selected color with the color you have select in PictureBackColor Property.
    * There're also 5 BMP files within the zip (in Pictures dir). By placing them on the button and changing MaskColor & PictureBackColor Properties, you will see how does MaskColor & PictureBackColor works.
 * Added: Picture automatically will be aligned with text
 * Added: When you are in a design mode and OnUp Property sets to bsNone, a Dash-Dot-Dot box will be drawn over the button, so you can see where the button's region is.

What's new in v1.1?
 * Skin Support (Pretty cool. :) 
    * There's a Photoshop(.PSD) file within the zip file, so you can create your own button skin :). The picture formats should be  82(W) x 115(H).
 * Picture Property (as requested :)
    Note: picture can only be on the left side of the button
 * Fixed Enabled Property (False was not working right)

ENJOY :)
